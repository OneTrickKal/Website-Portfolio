                <p class="pL">- <span class="PList">Learn Japanese,</span> this is important to me as i'd love to move to japan later on in life. The reason why would be that i'd like to work as a software developer there, i also think that it looks peaceful, respectful and gorgeous.</p>
                <p class="pL">- <span class="PList">Work on learning Game development.</span> I really enjoy video games, be it an online game or singleplayer story games they both keep me interested and i feel like it'd be interesting to express myself and ideas i have through game design.</p>
                <p class="pL">- <span class="PList">Continue to familiarize myself with diffrent programming languages,</span> right now i have my eyes set on C plus plus, C# and Java</p>
                <p class="pL">- <span class="PList">Work My way from a level 3 apprenticeship to a junior software developer for a known company.</span></p>

                <h2 class="ah2">My story so far:</h2>
                <p class="ap">Growing up i've been fascinated by computers, programs and gaming. my father introduced me to all of this at a young age, at the age of 9 i built my first pc along side him. Since then i've built computers for my friends and myself multiple times and had to troubleshoot the computers many many times.</p>
                <p class="ap">Around the age of 13-14 i developed and intrest for using C++ and python to make little applications that'd help me in the games that i played, for example i made macros that would allow me to automate some process of my games, this intrest developed and i started to look into game hacking and ofcourse it was completely beyond me how any of it worked, however i kept at it and tried to learn through videos and articles writen by other people. This lead to me making a cheat utilising C++ and another memory reading software to make a DLL file that i could inject into the game to give me infinate items and resources, this was very basic but i was very happy.</p>
                <p class="ap">I kind of lost interest at this point for anything related to coding, i took up other hobbys such as Digital ART, Video Editing, Electronical work and Gaming, however during my GCSE's i had to complete a Python coding marathon, it'd last 4 weeks and would count towards my grade, at the time i was very unattentive to my school work and that being the case i didn't make effort leading me to not do aswell as the others. This motivated me to again take up the coding hobby, this time i wanted to develop applications and make a video game, i started with making a few application in c#, i then took to python with TKINTER and lastly i started game development in the UNITY engine.</p>
